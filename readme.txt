Iteration 2 submission

Current log ins just use the nure/admin ID and password ,  this is an issue, in theory a nurse and admin could have the same id and password, in which case the nurse's account would be logged into.  Solution to be implemented -> make log in more sophisticated than just using nurse/admin ID as username.

nurse log ins

id: 1, password: password
id: 2, password: password2

admin log ins

id: 1, password: testpassword1
id: 2, password: testpassword2
